      <h3 id="legacy"><strong>Legacy</strong></h3>
        <p>The impact Michael "His Airness" Jordan had in the game of basketball is what defines his legacy. It was Jordan who truly made the game global with his electrifying playing style and world famous sneaker line, Air Jordan.
          In 2014, Jordan was named the first ever NBA player to become a billionaire, much due to the success of Air Jordan, which has helped build Nike in to one of the worlds leading sportswear brands.
          <br>Jordan has been inducted to the Naishmith Basketball Hall Of Fame for both his achievements in the NBA and his contributions to the 1992 Olympics USA Men's Basketball team, since dubbed "The Dream Team". His number 23 is retired both by the Chicago Bulls as well as the Miami Heat, even if Jordan never played a game for the Heat.
